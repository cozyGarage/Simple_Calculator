This is a simple project I use to follow the standard practice. Mainly to streamlized how to start a project

## Acceptance Criteria
 User wants a simple calculator, that can add 2 numbers and show the result with at least 4 basic operator.
 have case insensitivity

 first number = get input from user  
 if the first number is not numeric then print warning  
 second number = get input from user  
 if the second number is not numeric then print warning  
 operation = get input from user  
 lower case the operation for case insensitivity  
 if operation is + or "add" then   
 print fist number + second number  
 if operation is - or "subtract" then  
  print fist number - second number  
 if operation is * or "multiply" then  
   print fist number * second number  
 if operatin is / or "divide" then
